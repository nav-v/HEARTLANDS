POINT (103.7280321 1.334457),Latex Cup,"You are now standing in Jurong Lake Gardens’ allotment gardens. These are green spaces where aspiring gardeners can lease small plots to grow vegetables, herbs, and fruits. Across Singapore, there are now more than 2,400 allotment plots in 28 parks and gardens. Under NParks’ Allotment Gardening Scheme, households can ballot for a raised planter bed, complete with soil and storage space, at just over $62 a year. Schemes like Gardening with Edibles have encouraged more Singaporeans to grow their own food, with a goal of 3,000 allotment plots by 2030.

This is not the first time the banks of the Jurong River have been used for farming. In the 19th century, plantations of gambier and pepper cleared the surrounding jungles, but the crop quickly exhausted the soil. By the early 1900s, global demand for rubber transformed Jurong again. With the booming automobile industry requiring rubber for tyres, Malaya supplied half the world’s production by 1920. Much of it was traded through Singapore, which became the “rubber capital of the world.”

Rubber estates soon dominated Jurong’s landscape, owned by figures such as Chew Boon Lay, Tan Lark Sye, and members of the Chettiar community. Chew’s plantation was so extensive and prominent that the area itself, and later the Boon Lay MRT station, took its name from him. Latex cups, small vessels attached to the bark of rubber trees to collect dripping sap, became a familiar tool of plantation workers across these estates.",
POINT (103.7267383 1.3311575),Movie Ticket,"Where you are standing once housed the Jurong Drive-In Cinema, run by the Cathay Organisation. Opened on 14 July 1971, it was Singapore’s first and only drive-in theatre. 

The drive-in could accommodate 900 cars and 300 walk-in visitors in a front gallery, all watching an elevated screen 14.3 by 30.4 metres wide. Tickets cost $2 for adults and $1 for children. Sound was played over nearly 900 standing speakers, with some cars having individual speakers clipped to their windows.

For courting couples, the cinema quickly became a popular destination due to the long drive to the west. Sales executive Felix Goh recalled going on a double date, where the prized back seats were in demand. “We tossed a coin over which couple should occupy the back seat. My friend won,” he quipped. 

The venue also became notorious for antisocial behaviour, from car and motorcycle racing before shows to sleepless nights for nearby residents. In 1982, a police crackdown impounded 84 motorcycles and issued 20 speeding tickets. Even crime played out here, though not always successfully: in 1977, eight masked youths armed with parangs broke into the cinema office, escaping with only a torchlight worth $5.25.

Practical problems plagued the venue. Without air-conditioning, cars became stifling in Singapore’s humid nights, while rain left windscreens fogged or splashed. By the 1980s, attendance had dwindled to 200 viewers a night. The arrival of cheap pirated videotapes sealed its fate, and on 30 September 1985, the Jurong Drive-In closed with just 50 cars present at its final screenings.

Today, both the cinema and the Cathay Organisation that ran it are gone",
POINT (103.7301145 1.3382391),Bonsai,"Opened in 1992, the Bonsai Garden in Jurong’s Chinese Garden is the largest Suzhou-style bonsai garden outside of China. It houses a curated collection of beautifully manicured miniature trees, shaped with artistry and patience.

As you walk through this section, you may notice a shift in atmosphere. The rest of the Chinese Garden was built in the grand, symmetrical Imperial style. In Imperial gardens, glazed tiles, elaborate carvings, and bright colours such as red and yellow dominate, as these were traditionally associated with royalty. By contrast, the Suzhou section is more subdued. Here, dark grey unglazed clay tiles, plainer roofs, and meandering paths create a quieter, humbler aesthetic that complements the bonsai on display.

In its original plans, the Bonsai Garden was meant to showcase over 2,000 bonsai from around the world, arranged in groups according to style and the rocks and plants used. Another 400 bonsai were to be created locally, using raw material from across ASEAN. Although bonsai is a Japanese word, the art itself originated in China, where it is known as penjing or penzai. Penjing often presents miniature landscapes combining rocks, trees, and figurines in a wilder, natural style, while bonsai tends toward a more refined, stylised depiction of single trees. To learn more about bonsai and penjing, visit the Visitors Centre at the western end of this section.

Beyond this garden, Jurong has another connection to Suzhou. In the early 1990s, Singapore was deepening its engagement with China as it began to see investment in China as a natural extension of its economic strategy. In fact, plans for this Bonsai Garden were first unveiled in Suzhou during a two-week trip to China by then-Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Soon after, then-Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew proposed a government-to-government venture to build a modern industrial estate in Suzhou, blending Singapore’s Jurong Industrial Estate expertise with China’s development needs. The China–Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park (CS-SIP) was formally launched on 26 February 1994. Though ultimately successful, the project was highly controversial, with the elder Lee himself criticising bureaucratic hurdles, weak local support, and competition from cheaper nearby sites.",

In the 1960s, planners envisioned Jurong Lake as a chain of eight man-made islands created by dredging the bends of the Jurong River. At the inaugural meeting of the Jurong Town Corporation in June 1968, Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee described how these islands would be landscaped into themed gardens and connected by decorative bridges.

The first island, and the most southern most, was eventually developed into a golf course. The second island became the Japanese Garden, following the original plan. 

The third to sixth islands were designed as the Chinese Garden. Though the 1974 street map still shows them as four smaller islets linked by bridges, in practice they were merged into one large landmass. Right now, as you cross thisstream, you are technically moving from one of these islets to another.

The seventh and eighth islands at the northern end of the lake, planned as picnic grounds with ponds and a restaurant, seem to not have been built.

POINT (103.7283051 1.3396371),Yin and Yang Token,"Balance is one of the guiding principles of the Chinese Garden, and it greets you from the very entrance. Guarding the gates are two mighty marble lions, symbols of authority and felicity. They always appear in pairs, manifesting yin and yang. The male lion rests his paw on an embroidered ball, representing the external and material world. The female steadies a cub beneath her paw, symbolising the cycle of life and the living spirit within. Together, they protect both the structure and the soul. In some traditions the male’s mouth is open while the female’s is closed, forming the sacred syllable “om” - creation and completion.

The theme of balance continues deeper inside. In front of you, the Twin Pagodas embody yin and yang in architectural form. The broader Cloud Draping Tower (Pi Yun Ge, ___) represents Yang, active and expansive, its very name evoking clouds enveloping the sky. Opposite it, the slender Moon Receiving Tower (Yeh Yueh Lou, ___) represents Yin, receptive and nurturing, welcoming the moon’s gentle light. Both rise three storeys high, reflecting the auspicious use of odd numbers in Chinese architecture.

More generally, during the construction of the Chinese Garden in the early 1970s, great attention was paid to harmony and proportion. Traditional Chinese architects decreed that every structure must be balanced in height and size, and that buildings should harmonise with plants, flowing streams, and winding pebble paths. The contractors overseeing construction made multiple trips to China to study classical styles and consult experts, ensuring that every element of Jurong’s Chinese Garden reflected this enduring principle of balance.

On a grander level, when looking at the lake as a whole, where the Chinese Garden is designed to be visually exciting, the Japanese Gardens are designed with a calmness to evoke inner peace and a meditative state. ",
POINT (103.7297358 1.3382861),Crown,"Along this path you will find eight sculptures of legendary Chinese heroes, each chosen to embody virtues such as loyalty, righteousness, and patriotism. Among them are Lin Zexu, the Qing official who fought the opium trade in 1840; Zheng He, the Ming navigator whose voyages brought him to Southeast Asia and Africa; Wen Tianxiang, a Song general who resisted the invading Mongols; Hua Mulan, the woman warrior who disguised herself as a man; and Guan Yu, celebrated in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms for loyalty and courage.

[statues.jpg]

These sculptures were not state commissions but gifts. In 1991, businessman Goi Seng Hui, better known as Sam Goi, the “Popiah King,” donated S$1 million to create and install the statues at Marina City Park, then envisioned as Singapore’s premier “City in a Garden” park. Goi expressed hope that they would not be “just another backdrop for wedding photos,” but a permanent showcase of values such as filial piety, loyalty, righteousness, benevolence, and love for all races.

Their unveiling sparked public debate. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who officiated the ceremony, said he hoped to see a multicultural representation of heroes at the park, including figures from Malay and Indian traditions. Community leaders suggested that their own legendary heroes, such as the Malay warrior Hang Tuah and the Indian sage Thiruvalluvar, could one day be represented alongside the Chinese figures. Others, however, argued that statues were a low priority compared to urgent needs like improving children’s education. MUIS President Zainul Abidin Rasheed added that Malay heroes should be honoured in symbolic rather than physical form.

When Marina City Park closed in 2007 to make way for Gardens by the Bay, the statues were relocated here.

[sam_g.jpg]

Sam Goi’s own story is tied to Jurong. Arriving in Singapore as a child migrant, he began with little, eventually setting up a mechanical engineering workshop serving businesses in Jurong. In 1977, he diversified by acquiring a small popiah skin factory, Tee Yih Jia, which he transformed into a global frozen foods leader. Its flagship brand Spring Home is now sold worldwide.",
POINT (103.7288695 1.338935),Wedding Ring,"The Stoneboat is a famous feature of traditional Chinese architecture, designed so visitors can admire the surrounding scenery while feeling as if they were aboard a vessel floating on water. The version here in Jurong’s Chinese Garden follows the Beijing style, with some adaptations in its materials and design.

Stone boats are not just ornamental. Their boat-like form, blending seamlessly with the water, reflects Taoist ideals of harmony with nature. At the same time, the paradox of a vessel that cannot sail plays with the theme of illusion and reality, so central to Chinese art and literature. These pavilions also served as scholarly retreats, places for poetry and quiet contemplation, and their solidity came to symbolise permanence — an eternal counterpoint to wooden boats that decay or sink.

[stoneboat.jpg]

In Singapore, the Stoneboat also served another purpose. In the late 1970s, the Chinese Garden became a popular destination for wedding photography. It was estimated that around 200 couples each month came here in their wedding finery to pose amid the bridges, pavilions, and lakeside views. To serve this demand, in June 1982 the Registry of Marriages opened a branch in the garden’s Stone Boat itself. The location offered couples the convenience of solemnising their marriages and taking photographs in the same picturesque setting.

At its peak, at least 100 couples used the Stone Boat registry each month, especially on weekends. But the numbers dwindled after 1984, as couples found it more convenient to marry at the centrally located Fort Canning registry, and the branch soon close.

Across the pond, you’ll see the Tea Pavilion, featuring  three pavilions connected by a winding corridor, seemingly floating above the Lotus Pond – a design inspired by the Summer Palace. A poetic stone inscription greets visitors, inviting contemplation of the serene surroundings, including views of the Stoneboat.",
POINT (103.7309275 1.3391409),Hardhat,"You are now standing in front of the Cloud Piercing Pagoda (Ru Yun T’a), the seven-storey pagoda that rises over the Chinese Garden. Its design is a faithful replica of the Linggu Temple Pagoda in Nanjing, one of many landmarks carefully copied here in Jurong when the garden opened in 1975. Faithful replication was the guiding principle. As Mr Tan, the engineer in charge, explained at the time: “Everything is designed to be as authentic as possible. We don’t want a watered-down version.”The garden's design principles were based on classical northern Chinese imperial architecture, particular the Song Dynasty period (960-1279). 

The 13-arch White Rainbow Bridge echoes Beijing’s Seventeen-Arch Bridge. The tea house recreates the meandering corridors of the Summer Palace. On the northern shore, the twin pagodas mirrores the Spring and Autumn Pagodas in  Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Together they created, in one reporter’s words, a “many-splendoured thing.”

But these structures were hard to build. This was the first project of its kind in Singapore, and local labourers had little experience with traditional Chinese architectural techniques. Translating two-dimensional plans into timber, stone, and tile required specialised skills. Workers were trained on the job, guided by Taiwanese mentors who brought their expertise to Jurong. ",
POINT (103.7295396 1.335076),Giftbox,"The Japanese Garden was the first island to be built out on Jurong Lake, opening in 1973 as the largest Japanese garden outside of Japan at the time. It is also known as Seiwaen, a name derived from Sei (Singapore), Wa (Japan), and En (Garden) — literally “Singapore’s Japanese Garden.”

The project cost about $3 million, with $1.8 million provided by a Singapore Government grant and the remainder donated, largely by the Japanese Government. Through its Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency, Japan contributed the expertise of Professor Kinsaku Nakane, the country’s leading garden and landscape artist at the time. Designing the garden with his assistants, he took inspiration from the aesthetics of gardens during the Muromachi period (1392-1568) and the Momoyama period (1568-1615).

The Japanese Chamber of Commerce also contributed 500 tons of rocks, valued at over $180,000, along with 10 stone lanterns. Some of these lanterns can still be seen in front of you today.

This tradition of gifting continues. In 2021, US chipmaker Micron Technology donated S$1 million to support the development of the Water Lily Pond at the Japanese Garden. Their contribution funded a smart water management system that uses natural vegetation and microbes to filter the water, with sensors monitoring quality in real time.",
