POINT (103.7247079 1.3401631),Fishing Rod,fixed,,"In the early 1900s, Chinese settlers introduced aquaculture practices, while Malay villagers combined net fishing with prawn ponds built in muddy estuaries and mangrove swamps. By the 1950s, Singapore had some 1,000 acres of prawn ponds, and half of them were in Jurong. These were the most productive in the country, yielding nearly 1,000 kilograms of prawns per acre compared to less than 45 kilograms at Pulau Ubin. The ponds you see around you today probably do not contain prawns, but they are meant to mimic tidal patterns, ripples, and currents similar to those at coastal shores where prawn ponds once stood. Clusia Cove, a three-hectare water playground in Jurong Lake Gardens, lets children experience water play while also learning about water cycles and ecological balance. Clusia Cove also demonstrates natural water cleansing. Water circulates in a closed loop through a cleansing biotope, the playground, and an eco-pond. Sand beds and semi-aquatic plants like the Common Susum (Hanguana malayanum) filter and oxygenate the water, while ultraviolet treatment ensures it remains safe. The eco-pond itself mimics a freshwater wetland, where substrate filters debris and plants provide further purification before the loop begins again. The cove is named after one such plant — the Autograph Tree (Clusia rosea).""",rod.jpg

You’re now at Cascading Creek, a facsimile of a Southeast Asian river. It hints at what Jurong once was: a tangle of jungle and swamp stitched by the old Jurong River. An amusing account of a police raid on a Jurong counterfeiting den in 1904 captures this:

“Last night at 10.45 Insp. Branagan and a party of detectives raided a house … in the jungle. It would have been a difficult matter even in daylight to get to the house, but at night it was extremely dangerous as the path led through dense jungle and swamp … when the party arrived at the house they were rather done up and some presented a wretched appearance, having been unfortunate enough to fall into swamp holes.”

[cascadingcreek.jpg]

Jurong’s river story is one of twin clearings. Up to the 1820s, Orang Laut and Malay villages lined the river mouths while the interior stayed a green. The first big clearing came in the 19th century: gambier and pepper estates chewed through forest, exhausting soils and shifting on. By the early 1900s, rubber took over; with tyres fuelling the automobile age, Malaya supplied about half the world’s rubber by 1920, and Singapore styled itself the “rubber capital of the world.” Forest fell to rows of plantation trees; streams were tapped, straightened, and tamed.

[industrialisation.jpg]

The second upheaval was industrialisation in the 1960s–70s. As Finance Minister Hon Sui Sen noted at the Chinese Garden’s opening, Jurong once “possessed those elements” of lakes, streams, woods, hills, and plains – yet development demanded earth and access. Some corridors, like the upper Jurong River, were set aside; beyond them, many hills were levelled and lowlands infilled with millions of tons of earth. The lake you see today is a by-product of this remaking – Economic Development Board officers converted Sungei Jurong into a managed lake to supply industry and create new leisure on its shores.",chainsaw.png
POINT (103.7280321 1.334457),Latex Cup,fixed,,"You are now standing in Jurong Lake Gardens’ allotment gardens. These are green spaces where aspiring gardeners can lease small plots to grow vegetables, herbs, and fruits. Across Singapore, there are now more than 2,400 allotment plots in 28 parks and gardens. Under NParks’ Allotment Gardening Scheme, households can ballot for a raised planter bed, complete with soil and storage space, at just over $62 a year. Schemes like Gardening with Edibles have encouraged more Singaporeans to grow their own food, with a goal of 3,000 allotment plots by 2030.

This is not the first time the banks of the Jurong River have been used for farming. In the 19th century, plantations of gambier and pepper cleared the surrounding jungles, but the crop quickly exhausted the soil. By the early 1900s, global demand for rubber transformed Jurong again. With the booming automobile industry requiring rubber for tyres, Malaya supplied half the world’s production by 1920. Much of it was traded through Singapore, which became the “rubber capital of the world.”

Rubber estates soon dominated Jurong’s landscape, owned by figures such as Chew Boon Lay, Tan Lark Sye, and members of the Chettiar community. Chew’s plantation was so extensive and prominent that the area itself, and later the Boon Lay MRT station, took its name from him. Latex cups, small vessels attached to the bark of rubber trees to collect dripping sap, became a familiar tool of plantation workers across these estates.",latex.png
POINT (103.7267383 1.3311575),Movie Ticket,fixed,,"Where you are standing once housed the Jurong Drive-In Cinema, run by the Cathay Organisation. Opened on 14 July 1971, it was Singapore’s first and only drive-in theatre. 

The drive-in could accommodate 900 cars and 300 walk-in visitors in a front gallery, all watching an elevated screen 14.3 by 30.4 metres wide. Tickets cost $2 for adults and $1 for children. Sound was played over nearly 900 standing speakers, with some cars having individual speakers clipped to their windows.

For courting couples, the cinema quickly became a popular destination due to the long drive to the west. Sales executive Felix Goh recalled going on a double date, where the prized back seats were in demand. “We tossed a coin over which couple should occupy the back seat. My friend won,” he quipped. 

The venue also became notorious for antisocial behaviour, from car and motorcycle racing before shows to sleepless nights for nearby residents. In 1982, a police crackdown impounded 84 motorcycles and issued 20 speeding tickets. Even crime played out here, though not always successfully: in 1977, eight masked youths armed with parangs broke into the cinema office, escaping with only a torchlight worth $5.25.

Practical problems plagued the venue. Without air-conditioning, cars became stifling in Singapore’s humid nights, while rain left windscreens fogged or splashed. By the 1980s, attendance had dwindled to 200 viewers a night. The arrival of cheap pirated videotapes sealed its fate, and on 30 September 1985, the Jurong Drive-In closed with just 50 cars present at its final screenings.

In Imperial gardens, glazed tiles, elaborate carvings, and bright colours such as red and yellow dominate, as these were traditionally associated with royalty. By contrast, the Suzhou section is more subdued. Here, dark grey unglazed clay tiles, plainer roofs, and meandering paths create a quieter, humbler aesthetic that complements the bonsai on display.

In its original plans, the Bonsai Garden was meant to showcase over 2,000 bonsai from around the world, arranged in groups according to style and the rocks and plants used. Another 400 bonsai were to be created locally, using raw material from across ASEAN. Although bonsai is a Japanese word, the art itself originated in China, where it is known as penjing or penzai.

The park ultimately closed in 2006 due to financial reasons, being unable to compete with the Singapore Zoo or Bird Park. 

Though there is only one crocodile farm left in Singapore, the city-state continues to play a large role in the crocodile skin trade. In 2018, for instance, Singapore was the largest importer of reptile skins from Africa, accounting for 60% of all reptile skins exported. This dominance is largely due to the presence of major tanneries in the country - chief among them, Heng Long Leather. Heng Long has long been a global player, supplying tanned crocodile leather to fashion houses like Hermès and Gucci, even before LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy) acquired a 51% stake in the company in 2011.

These sculptures were not state commissions but gifts. In 1991, businessman Goi Seng Hui, better known as Sam Goi, the “Popiah King,” donated S$1 million to create and install the statues at Marina City Park, then envisioned as Singapore’s premier “City in a Garden” park. Goi expressed hope that they would not be “just another backdrop for wedding photos,” but a permanent showcase of values such as filial piety, loyalty, righteousness, benevolence, and love for all races.

Their unveiling sparked public debate. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who officiated the ceremony, said he hoped to see a multicultural representation of heroes at the park, including figures from Malay and Indian traditions. Community leaders suggested that their own legendary heroes, such as the Malay warrior Hang Tuah and the Indian sage Thiruvalluvar, could one day be represented alongside the Chinese figures. Others, however, argued that statues were a low priority compared to urgent needs like improving children’s education. MUIS President Zainul Abidin Rasheed added that Malay heroes should be honoured in symbolic rather than physical form.

When Marina City Park closed in 2007 to make way for Gardens by the Bay, the statues were relocated here.

But these structures were hard to build. This was the first project of its kind in Singapore, and local labourers had little experience with traditional Chinese architectural techniques. Translating two-dimensional plans into timber, stone, and tile required specialised skills. Workers were trained on the job, guided by Taiwanese mentors who brought their expertise to Jurong.

POINT (103.7295396 1.335076),Giftbox,fixed,,"The Japanese Garden was the first island to be built out on Jurong Lake, opening in 1973 as the largest Japanese garden outside of Japan at the time. It is also known as Seiwaen, a name derived from Sei (Singapore), Wa (Japan), and En (Garden) — literally “Singapore’s Japanese Garden.”

The project cost about $3 million, with $1.8 million provided by a Singapore Government grant and the remainder donated, largely by the Japanese Government. Through its Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency, Japan contributed the expertise of Professor Kinsaku Nakane, the country’s leading garden and landscape artist at the time. Designing the garden with his assistants, he took inspiration from the aesthetics of gardens during the Muromachi period (1392-1568) and the Momoyama period (1568-1615).

The Japanese Chamber of Commerce also contributed 500 tons of rocks, valued at over $180,000, along with 10 stone lanterns. Some of these lanterns can still be seen in front of you today.

This tradition of gifting continues. In 2021, US chipmaker Micron Technology donated S$1 million to support the development of the Water Lily Pond at the Japanese Garden.

You’re now in the Sunken Garden, a gorge-like passage where walls rise to 3.5 m and drip with more than 200 epiphyte species (plants that grow on other plants or structures). A living moss wall of Paras stone keeps the air cool and damp. At its heart, a cenote-inspired water feature acts as both showpiece and rain-harvesting system – an air-well that draws daylight down to a still pool and recycles stormwater through the garden (a “cenote” is a natural sinkhole formed when limestone collapses to expose groundwater, most famously on Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula).

Walk out of the passage and you enter the Floral Garden, a showcase partly imagined and laid out by students from ITE College East, NAFA, and Singapore Polytechnic. The garden is used as a practical learning platform to let students design planting plots and learn about the evolution of a landscape.

Both spaces were shaped by the community. NParks set out to make Jurong Lake “a people’s garden”, by the people, for the people, and “more than 32,000 voices” fed into its design. During the design stage, a roaming exhibition and townhall sessions surfaced priorities; during construction, tree-planting days and public displays kept the loop open. One clear preference - “water-sensitive” landscapes - now runs through the precinct: from the cenote lightwell and rain-recycling pool in the Sunken Gardens to the Water Lily Garden beyond.",megaphone.png

A 1994 letter to The Straits Times caught the mood: the “grand” approach from Chinese Garden MRT felt flat - a small ticket kiosk, a tired bridge. Inside, debris floated on the lake, paint flaked from bridges, and rest spots were scarce. Another visitor called the Japanese Garden “run down and neglected”: carp gone from the ponds, a forlorn shelter with a lone hawker, stonework and bridges in disrepair. Two beautiful and historic gardens - starved of care.


The turn began in 2008, when URA unveiled the Jurong Lake District blueprint, Singapore’s “second CBD” wrapped around a 220-hectare lakeside with 70 hectares of water. Plans promised new green space, an enhanced promenade, and a waterfront park by Lakeside MRT, with the Chinese and Japanese Gardens earmarked for fresh facilities and livelier programming.

A decade on, momentum became mandate. In June 2014, then-PM Lee Hsien Loong apparently visited the gardens and noted that “still looked basically the same as they did in the 1970s”, asking planners to consider rework the gardens. At the National Day Rally that year a single National Garden, Jurong Lake Gardens, uniting the Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden, and Jurong Lake Park, alongside a new Science Centre on the lake’s north shore was announced. In September 2024, the rejuvenated Chinese and Japanese Gardens finally reopened, officiated by Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong. ",cobwebs.png

But did you know that Jurong might have once had an actual waterfall? On two historic maps (1873 and 1911), the label “Ayer Toorjoon” appears at a meander of Sungei Jurong - likely a misspelling of Air Terjun (Malay for “waterfall”)- opposite the river, southeast of today’s Japanese Garden and near the current Science Centre site. The name vanishes from maps after 1911, and not much else is known about the mystery waterfall.

Jurong has another connection to waterfalls. When Jurong Bird Park opened in 1971, its aviary carried a 30-metre man-made waterfall - then among the tallest anywhere. Though the Bird Park has now shifted to Mandai, planners have said they’ll consider existing features like the waterfall and Jurong Hill Tower as they rethink the hill, and will seek public feedback to shape what comes next.

Singapore’s obsession with artificial large waterfalls (literally) reached new heights in 2019, when Jewel Changi Airport – a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex – opened with a a 40-metre indoor waterfall, that is the world’s largest. ",bamboo.png

During construction, budgets swelled from the original S$50 million to S$70 million, with talk of a S$100 million war chest and a hotel next door. The park opened in 1992, but the part studio, part heritage set never quite worked as a theme park. Few rides, a steep S$15 ticket (then far pricier than Sentosa), and exhibits that felt static. What thrilled visitors were the live shows, acrobats vaulting through courtyards, sword fights erupting on the arch bridge and

As a studio, it saw little camera time. One notable feature film, the 1993 Hong Kong New Year comedy All’s Well, Ends Well Too, used the sets, most productions looked elsewhere. Attendance ebbed through the mid-90s and the Asian Financial Crisis dealt the final blow.

Closing in 1999, the park remained abandoned till 2008, when it was levelled. Today the plot is being remade as Taman Jurong Skyline, a new HDB blocks with views over Jurong Lake Gardens.

Before its transformation, the river wound its way across the landscape, forming a distinctive “S” shape — curving east of today’s Japanese Garden and then west of the Chinese Garden.

This serpentine course inspired the plans to convert the meandering river into a managed lake. At the inaugural meeting of the Jurong Town Corporation in June 1968, Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee described the vision: “A large park is being constructed on the west bank of the river. Eight man-made islands will be created in the river by dredging the necks of the promontories produced by the winding shape of the river; the river will then be converted into a lake.”",snake.png
